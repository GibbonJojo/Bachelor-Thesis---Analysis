# Bachelor-Thesis - Analysis
The analysis pipeline, I used for my bachelor thesis.

Also, code to extract the data from the .mat files. Right now, I dont't have a lot of time to document the code more than it already is; I hope I can find some time. But I am available for any questions you have


Feel free to use the code for your analysis. I would appreciate if you cite my thesis if you decide to do so:

Neurofeedback of the temporoparietal junction using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, Johannes Uttecht (2019)
