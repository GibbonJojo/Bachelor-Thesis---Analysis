# Bachelor-Thesis - Analysis
The analysis pipeline, I used for my bachelor thesis.

Also, code to extract the data from the .mat files. Right now, I dont't have a lot of time to document the code more than it already is; I hope I can find some time. But I am available for any questions you have

The code for extracting the data, as well as for the Boxcox transformation and data melting is written in Python. All plots and analysis steps are done in R.


Feel free to use the code for your analysis. I would appreciate if you cite my thesis if you decide to do so:
